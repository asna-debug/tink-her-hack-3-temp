### Project Description

Our project is a self-billing system designed to enhance the efficiency of the checkout process. It eliminates long queues and speeds up transactions by allowing users to generate their own bills seamlessly.

### The Problem Statement

The traditional billing system is slow and inefficient, often leading to long waiting times at counters.

### The Solution

Our self-billing system enables customers to scan products, generate bills, and complete payments independently, ensuring a faster and hassle-free shopping experience.
